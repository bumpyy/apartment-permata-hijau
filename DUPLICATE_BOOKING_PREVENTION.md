# Duplicate Booking Prevention System

## Overview

The court booking system implements a comprehensive duplicate booking prevention mechanism to ensure that no two tenants can book the same time slot on the same court. This system works at multiple levels to prevent conflicts and provide real-time feedback to users.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-time Conflict Detection
- **Slot Availability Checking**: Before allowing a slot to be selected, the system checks if it's already booked by any tenant
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users receive instant notifications when trying to select an unavailable slot
- **Automatic Removal**: Conflicting slots are automatically removed from the user's selection

### 2. Multi-level Validation
- **Selection Time**: When a user tries to select a time slot
- **Confirmation Time**: Before showing the booking confirmation modal
- **Processing Time**: During the actual booking creation process

### 3. Real-time Data Refresh
- **Auto-refresh**: Booking data is automatically refreshed every 30 seconds
- **Manual Refresh**: Users can manually refresh booking data using the refresh button
- **Smart Refresh**: Refresh stops when the page is not visible (user switches tabs)

## Implementation Details

### Database Level
- No unique constraints on the database level (to allow cancellation and rebooking)
- Application-level validation using the `Booking::isSlotBooked()` method
- Excludes cancelled bookings from conflict checking

### Application Level

#### Booking Model Methods
```php
// Check if a specific slot is already booked
Booking::isSlotBooked($courtId, $date, $startTime)

// Get all booked slots for a court in a date range
Booking::getBookedSlotsForCourt($courtId, $startDate, $endDate)
```

#### Component Methods
```php
// Check if a slot is already booked by anyone
isSlotAlreadyBooked($date, $startTime)

// Check for conflicts in selected slots
checkForBookingConflicts()

// Validate slots are still available
validateSlotsStillAvailable()

// Refresh booking data
refreshBookingData()
```

## Conflict Resolution Process

### 1. Slot Selection
When a user tries to select a time slot:
1. Check if the slot is already booked
2. If booked, show warning and prevent selection
3. If available, add to selection

### 2. Before Confirmation
Before showing the confirmation modal:
1. Check all selected slots for conflicts
2. Remove any conflicting slots
3. Show message about removed slots
4. Only proceed if valid slots remain

### 3. During Processing
During the actual booking creation:
1. Double-check each slot before creating the booking
2. If any slot becomes unavailable, stop processing
3. Show specific error message
4. Allow user to try again

## Error Handling

### Conflict Scenarios
- **Slot Taken**: "‚è∞ This time slot was just booked by another tenant. Please select a different time."
- **Multiple Conflicts**: Beautiful modal showing all conflicting slots with details
- **Processing Conflict**: "‚è∞ Slot [date] at [time] was just booked by another tenant. Please refresh and try again."
- **New Bookings Detected**: "üÜï [X] new booking(s) detected. Availability has been updated."

### User Experience
